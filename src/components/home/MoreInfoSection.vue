          Why does this app have a preminum version for Playstore users?
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4 max-w-5xl text-xl text-gray-500 lg:mx-auto">
          As publishing an app on the playstore requires money, we've decided to have one-time-paid preminum features. However, we value the privacy and freedom of users to not be tracked by Google or even use google products and thus we will always provide the app freely, and with every feature in F-droid.
